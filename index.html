<h3> 
  New to Islam
</h3>
  <p>To enter the fold of Islam, all one needs to do is to pronounce the testimony of faith (shahaadah) with sincere conviction, being fully aware of its meaning. The shahaadah is the first and most important of the five pillars of Islam and consists of two parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Ashhadu an laailaaha illallaah: This means I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah; I worship Him alone without associating any partners with Him in worship. </li>
<li> Wa ash hadu anna Muhammad an rasool-ullaah: This means And I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah whom he has sent to all mankind.</li>
</ul>

  <p> The moment a person embraces Islam is doubtless the greatest moment in his/her life. It signifies a rebirth through which he/she has come to better understand the actual reason behind our existence in this life. After pronouncing the testimony of faith, a new Muslim is recommended to take a bath (ghusl), washing his entire body with water. </p>
